# TurboFieldfare

Swift and Metal inference for Gemma 4 26B-A4B on Apple Silicon.

## Scope

This checkout is for running and reporting existing behavior. Do not edit source, change runtime defaults, or start optimization work unless the user asks.

## Layout and commands

`Sources/TurboFieldfareFormat/` owns the Foundation-only `.gturbo` v1 wire
contract. `Sources/TurboFieldfare/` is the runtime; `Sources/TurboFieldfareRepack/`,
`Sources/TurboFieldfareCLI/`, `Sources/TurboFieldfareServer/`, and
`Sources/TurboFieldfareApp/` contain the installer, CLI, loopback server, and
Mac app.
`Tests/` contains focused public tests; `docs/` contains design, benchmark, and experiment notes.

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo --resume
swift build -c release
.build/release/TurboFieldfareMac
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareCLI \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --prompt "The capital of France is" \
  --max-new 64
```

The installer streams the pinned model without staging the full source checkpoint. Set `HF_TOKEN` only if requested. The download is about 15 GB. Cancellation preserves verified completed ranges; continue them with `--resume` or remove them with `--discard-partial --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo`.

## Local server

Follow the [server guide](docs/OPENAI_SERVER.md) for launch commands, health
checks, client setup, prompt reuse, tool loops, and supported API behavior.
Apply the model-process checks below first; never start a second model process
or terminate an existing one.

Keep the server on `127.0.0.1`; it has no remote authentication or TLS, so do
not proxy, tunnel, or expose it. A tool call from the local model never bypasses
the client's normal permission policy. Keep the execution session alive while
the server is needed, and stop only a server you launched.

## SwiftUI state and previews

Use `@StoredState` from `TurboFieldfareMacPresentation` for view-owned state.
It aliases Apple's `SwiftUI.State<Value>` property wrapper, avoiding the State
macro plugin missing from some CLT installations. Keep reference construction
explicit; the wrapper evaluates inline initializers eagerly. Use
`PreviewProvider` for debug previews. Do not introduce direct State attributes
or Preview macros. Run `ruby Scripts/check_swiftui_macros.rb --self-test` and
`ruby Scripts/tests/swift_macro_probe_test.rb` when changing these surfaces.

## Test rules

Before a model run, require macOS 26+, Swift 6.2+, enough disk, acceptable `memory_pressure -Q`, a completed `scratch/gemma4.gturbo`, and no process from `pgrep -fl 'TurboFieldfareServer|TurboFieldfareMac|TurboFieldfareDecodeService|TurboFieldfareCLI|TurboFieldfarePackageTests|swiftpm-testing-helper|mlx_lm|mlx-lm'`. If a check fails, inform the user and stop; do not terminate apps or delete or reinstall the model.

Run package tests through `Scripts/test.sh`. Run only one app, CLI, or model-using test at a time.

For performance results, build release once and follow the [community benchmark guide](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md) exactly. Do not enable experimental controls or profiling.

Do not download a full checkpoint, duplicate the `.gturbo` model, create a worktree, or purge caches just to run tests.

Report the commit, hardware and RAM, macOS, Swift version, exact command, exit code, complete timing footer or error, and every protocol deviation. Treat results as measurements, not performance ceilings.

## App controls

The Mac app sends prompts through the pinned Gemma 4 IT chat format. It
exposes context length, temperature, Top-K, Top-P, expert-cache slots, prefill,
and RDADVISE. The defaults are temperature `0.2`, Top-K `64`, and Top-P `0.95`.
The app saves conversation history locally and retains one live FP16 KV lineage.
Browsing the sidebar preserves that lineage; continuing another saved chat
replays its recorded tokens and replaces it. See
[Conversation history](README.md#conversation-history) for an overview.
The HUD shows generation rate, context use, decode-service memory, and,
on hover, cached-token reuse; Last run also shows time to first token and I/O.
Use **New Chat** to clear the transcript, KV lineage, gauge, and retained
images. Reloading or unloading keeps the transcript but marks it outside the
new model context. Build the app with its sibling
`TurboFieldfareDecodeService`; it never loads a second in-process model. See
[README](README.md) and [Runtime controls](docs/RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md).

## Images

Image support is an optional `<name>.vision.gturbo` companion pack that sits
beside the text model. Without it the text runtime behaves exactly as before.

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --vision-output scratch/gemma4.vision.gturbo \
  --text-model scratch/gemma4.gturbo
```

The model-free suites cover preprocessing, the tower kernels, the companion
format, the installer transaction, prompt rendering, and the server ingress.
Cases that need a real installed pack skip themselves when
`scratch/gemma4.gturbo` and its companion are missing, so a checkout without a
model still runs green.

Keep the image path fail-closed. If the pack is missing or invalid, say image
support is unavailable. Never accept an image and then answer as though it had
not been sent.
