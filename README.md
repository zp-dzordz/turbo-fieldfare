![TurboFieldfare Mac app generating text with Gemma 4 26B-A4B](docs/assets/turbofieldfare-app.webp)

Memory got expensive. So I gave a 26-billion-parameter model a ~2 GB budget.

TurboFieldfare runs the instruction-tuned
**[Gemma 4 26B-A4B](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/docs/core/model_card_4)**
without loading the entire 14.3 GB model into memory. It keeps the shared
1.35 GB core and FP16 KV cache in memory, then streams only the experts needed
for each token from SSD. This is what lets the model run on Macs with 8 GB of
RAM.

The runtime, streaming installer, CLI, and native Mac app are written in Swift
and Metal. TurboFieldfare is model-specific rather than a wrapper around MLX or
llama.cpp. The curated [experiment record](docs/experiments/EXPERIMENT_INVENTORY.md)
summarizes 103 measured results across kernels, caching, I/O, prefill, and
decode.

## Try it

```bash
git clone https://github.com/drumih/turbo-fieldfare.git
cd turbo-fieldfare
swift build -c release
.build/release/TurboFieldfareMac
```

On the first run, Swift Package Manager downloads and builds the Swift packages
required by the tokenizer. The complete release build includes the foreground
Mac app and its sibling decode-service executable.

When the app opens, choose **Download** and let TurboFieldfare fetch and repack
the pinned model (about 15 GB). Once it is ready, choose **Load Model**, type
your prompt, and press **Generate**.

## Using TurboFieldfare

TurboFieldfare provides a native Mac app, a command-line interface, and an
experimental loopback OpenAI-compatible server. They use the same `.gturbo`
model directory, but only one model-owning product should run at a time.

The Swift package exposes six products:

| Product | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `TurboFieldfare` | Swift library containing the runtime and Metal kernels |
| `TurboFieldfareMac` | Native Mac app for installation and generation |
| `TurboFieldfareDecodeService` | One-shot local model and Metal owner used by the Mac app |
| `TurboFieldfareCLI` | Command-line instruction chat and raw completion |
| `TurboFieldfareServer` | Loopback OpenAI-compatible Chat Completions server |
| `TurboFieldfareRepack` | Streaming model installer and install verifier |

### Requirements

- An Apple Silicon Mac; the validated target is an 8 GB M2 MacBook Air
- macOS 26 with Metal 4
- Xcode 26 and Swift 6.2 or newer
- Enough free storage for the ~14.3 GB model installation
- An internet connection for the first model install

The package is arm64-only. Older macOS and Metal versions are not supported.

### Prompting the model

The Mac app treats what you type as an instruction and handles Gemma's chat
formatting automatically. Just describe the task and include any context the
model needs.

Generation defaults to temperature `0.2`, Top-K `64`, and Top-P `0.95`. Set
temperature to `0` for deterministic greedy output. The model can still repeat
itself or give incorrect answers, so check important results.

The app and CLI support user and model messages plus optional system guidance;
they do not expose or execute tools. The loopback server accepts function-tool
declarations and returns model-produced tool calls for the client to authorize
and execute. Audio and video are not supported.

### Images

Images are supported through a vision tower, which installs as a companion
pack beside the text model. Install it once and the app, CLI, and server all
accept images. Without it they tell you image support is unavailable, and the
text runtime is untouched. The image tower requires an M2 or newer Apple
Silicon Mac; text-only inference remains available on M1.

[System design](docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md#images) covers how the tower runs and
what it costs on an 8 GB machine.

### Mac app

Clone the repository, then run the app from its root:

```bash
swift build -c release
.build/release/TurboFieldfareMac
```

Build the complete package so the app and its sibling decode service are both
available. When launched from this checkout, the app stores the model in
`scratch/gemma4.gturbo`.

#### Install the model

On first launch, the app checks the available storage and shows the download
and installed sizes. Choose **Download** to begin.

The installer never materializes the full source checkpoint. It streams the
required byte ranges from the pinned Hugging Face revision and repacks them
directly into the `.gturbo` layout as they arrive. This avoids a second full
checkpoint on disk and keeps scratch memory bounded.

The first installation transfers about 15 GB through bounded Hugging Face
range requests. Network speed and Hugging Face response times vary, so it can
take a while. The completed `.gturbo` installation occupies about 14.3 GB and
is accepted only after its manifest and file hashes have been validated.
Installation does not load the model into memory.

#### Load and generate

After installation:

1. Choose **Load Model**.
2. Enter a prompt in the composer.
3. Choose **Generate**, or press <kbd>Command</kbd>+<kbd>Return</kbd>. Use **Settings > Send Message With** to choose Return or Command-Return.
4. Send another message to continue the conversation, or choose **New Chat** to start over.
5. Use the stop button or <kbd>Escape</kbd> to end generation early.

The status bar shows generation progress, decode speed, and memory use. Use the
right pane to configure sampling, context length, expert-cache slots, and
runtime options. See [Runtime controls](docs/RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md) for details
and defaults.

Use **Settings → Text Size** to enlarge conversation and message-editor text
from 100% to 200%. Changes apply immediately and are remembered across launches.

#### Conversation history

The app saves chats locally so you can browse and continue them from the
sidebar. Every launch opens an empty chat. Only one conversation's model context
(KV cache) stays in memory.
Browsing other chats keeps that cache intact; continuing another chat replaces
it. **New Chat** starts fresh.

### Command-line interface

The CLI uses an existing `.gturbo` installation. If you installed the model
through the Mac app, it is already available at `scratch/gemma4.gturbo`.
Otherwise, install it from the command line:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --overwrite
```

Continue a cancelled or interrupted download:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --overwrite \
  --resume
```

Remove saved download state:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --discard-partial \
  --output scratch/gemma4.gturbo
```

The runtime accepts only a completed `.gturbo` directory with a final
`manifest.json`.

Verify an existing installation without loading the model:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --verify-install \
  --input-gturbo scratch/gemma4.gturbo
```

#### Install image support

The companion pack installs beside the text model:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareRepack \
  --vision-output scratch/gemma4.vision.gturbo \
  --text-model scratch/gemma4.gturbo
```

The pack adds about 1.1 GB. Verify it with `--verify-vision-install`, remove an
installed one with `--remove-vision-install`, and drop a cancelled download with
`--discard-partial --vision-output <dir>`. A cancelled transfer can also be
continued with `--resume`. The Mac app installs the same pack from its
**Image Support** section.

#### Send an image

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareCLI \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --chat-prompt "What is in this picture?" \
  --image photo.jpg
```

`--image` is repeatable and requires `--chat-prompt`; it cannot be combined
with `--prompt` or `--messages-file`. Without the companion pack the run stops
and says image support is unavailable.

A multi-turn conversation carries its images inside the messages file instead,
as `image_file` parts in any user message; `--image` covers the single-turn
case only. Either route needs at least 16 expert-cache slots, because an image
prompt always prefills chunked.

#### Instruction chat

Put chat messages in a JSON array and pass it with `--messages-file`:

```json
[
  {"role": "user", "content": "Explain why chunked prefill reduces time to first token while keeping memory bounded."}
]
```

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareCLI \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo \
  --messages-file messages.json
```

This formats messages in the same way as the Mac app. The CLI response limit
is set with `--max-new`, which defaults to 1,024 tokens. The Mac app can
generate until the selected context window is full.

Common generation options include `--max-context`, `--temperature`, `--top-k`,
`--top-p`, `--repetition-penalty`, `--seed`, and repeatable `--stop` strings.
Runtime options include `--expert-cache-slots`, `--expert-cache-policy`,
`--prefill`, `--prefill-chunk-tokens`, and `--rdadvise`; omitted options use
the [production defaults](docs/RUNTIME_CONTROLS.md). Run the following command
for the complete option list:

```bash
swift run -c release TurboFieldfareCLI --help
```

Generated text goes to standard output. Timing statistics go to standard error;
add `--quiet` to suppress that footer in scripts.

### Local OpenAI-compatible server

Build the server and point it at an installed model:

```bash
swift build -c release --product TurboFieldfareServer
.build/release/TurboFieldfareServer \
  --model scratch/gemma4.gturbo
```

It listens on `http://127.0.0.1:8080/v1` and supports Chat Completions,
streaming, function tools, and single-prefix prompt reuse. The client must
authorize and run every tool call. Keep the server on loopback; it has no
remote authentication or TLS.

See [Local server](docs/OPENAI_SERVER.md) for a test request, Python and
OpenCode setup, prompt reuse, tool handling, and the supported API subset.

## Test and contribute

Run the public test suite serially:

```bash
Scripts/test.sh
```

Before starting a model run, close memory-heavy apps and check
`memory_pressure -Q`. If it reports little free memory, postpone the run. Run
only one TurboFieldfare app, decode service, CLI, server, test, or other
local-model process at a time.

To contribute a comparable performance result, follow the
[community benchmark guide](docs/COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md).

## How the inference engine works

At each transformer layer, Metal computes attention and the router from
resident weights. The CPU uses the router's top-8 expert IDs to plan against
the layer's 16-slot LFU cache, then fills misses with bounded parallel `pread`
calls into Metal-visible buffers. Metal computes the resident shared-expert
branch while those reads run, then combines the shared and routed outputs.

Prompt prefill uses chunks of up to 128 tokens so one fetched expert can serve
multiple rows. Generation repeats the routed layer loop one token at a time.
The installer applies the same bounded-memory rule: it repacks remote ranges
directly into `.gturbo` without staging a full shard or tensor.

[Local AI On Apple Silicon uses 7X Less RAM](https://youtu.be/vHhephsP6vU).

For a visual introduction to the model architecture, see Maarten Grootendorst's
[A Visual Guide to Gemma 4](https://newsletter.maartengrootendorst.com/p/a-visual-guide-to-gemma-4).

[System design](docs/SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) explains the `.gturbo` layout, memory
ownership, prefill, router handoff, `cb1`/`io`/`cb2` phases, Metal kernels, and
correctness invariants.

## Status and scope

TurboFieldfare currently includes:

- Remote streaming repack into the `.gturbo` model format
- Instruction-tuned Gemma 4 26B-A4B with verified chat formatting
- 4-bit MLX affine embedding, attention, shared-expert, and routed-expert
  weights, with an 8-bit router
- Custom Metal kernels for quantized GEMV, attention, MoE, normalization,
  RoPE, sampling, and production fusions
- SSD-backed routed-expert streaming with a bounded expert cache
- Chunked prefill for one-shot prompts and new conversational turns, followed
  by token-by-token generation
- FP16 KV storage with bounded circular storage for 25 sliding-window layers
  and linear storage for 5 full-attention layers
- Exact split-K/V decode attention with distinct normalized K and V paths
- A Swift library, streaming installer, command-line interface, loopback
  OpenAI-compatible server, and native SwiftUI/AppKit Mac app with a sibling
  local decode service
- Optional image input from a separately installed companion pack: the vision
  tower runs on bounded scratch, image rows attend in both directions inside
  the sliding-window layers, and routed experts are released while the tower
  runs

Current scope is text input from the pinned Gemma 4 26B-A4B instruction
checkpoint on Apple Silicon Macs with at least 8 GB of RAM, plus image input
on M2 or newer Macs. Audio and video are out of scope.

### Future work

- Build iPhone and iPad apps, then measure inference speed and memory use on
  mobile hardware.
- Benchmark more Apple Silicon Macs, especially the base 16 GB M4 Mac mini and
  other 8 GB models.

## Afterword and the project name

Thanks for checking out this project!

My name is Andrey Mikhaylov. You can find me on
[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/andrey-mikhaylov-ios-dev/).
I am the author of TurboFieldfare and an iOS and Metal engineer. Most of my
work is with images, video, and on-device AI.

I dedicate this project to my wife, Sasha, the most supportive person I know.
She stands by me even through the hardest times. She loves wildlife, goes
birdwatching, and volunteers with our local birding community. Because of her,
I have also grown closer to birds and nature.

TurboFieldfare is named after the fieldfare, a member of the thrush family and
my favourite bird. It is not the most noticeable or brightly coloured bird, but
it definitely has a character and unique features of its own. I think the same
is true of this project: it may not be the most practical, but I built it with
my favourite tools, especially Metal, in my favourite field, on-device ML
inference. It definitely has its own character and unique features.

Next time you are outside, touch the grass and listen to the birds. Sometimes
it is the most beautiful thing you can do. And if you can, support your local
wildlife community. They do important work.

Thank you!
