# Runtime controls

The Mac app, CLI, and local server expose generation and runtime controls. The
app keeps them in its fixed right settings pane. FP16 is the fixed KV format.
Generation settings apply to the next turn or request; app load-time settings
require a reload.

## Generation controls

The Mac app and CLI expose these generation controls:

| Control | Mac values | CLI flag | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Maximum response | Automatic | `--max-new` | App: remaining context; CLI: 1,024 tokens | The app can use the context space left after the retained conversation and new turn. The CLI uses its explicit or default `--max-new` limit. |
| Maximum context | 4K, 8K, 16K, 32K, 64K, 128K, 256K, depending on your Mac's RAM and cache settings | `--max-context` | CLI and app: 8K; server: 16K | Sets the combined capacity for the prompt or conversation and the response. The app shows how much FP16 KV-cache memory each size adds. The server defaults to 16K because agent clients routinely send prompts near 8K. |
| Temperature | 0...2 in 0.05 steps | `--temperature` | 0.2 | `0` is greedy; positive values sample. |
| Top-K | Off or 1...256 | `--top-k` | 64 | Keeps at most K candidates. CLI `0` turns it off. |
| Top-P | Off or 0.01...1 | `--top-p` | 0.95 | Applies nucleus truncation before Top-K and is effective only while Top-K is enabled. |

With positive temperature, a CLI Top-P below `1` requires Top-K between `1`
and `256`. To disable both truncation controls, pass `--top-k 0 --top-p 1`.
Generation controls apply to the next request and do not require a model
reload. They are interactive product settings, not the fixed community
benchmark protocol.

## Runtime settings

The CLI and the [local server](OPENAI_SERVER.md) accept these flags with the
same names and values. Their defaults agree except for `--max-context`, which
the server defaults to 16,384 rather than 8,192. The server resolves them before it loads the
model, so an unsupported combination fails immediately with the usage text.

| Control | Mac values | CLI and server flag | Production default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Expert-cache slots | 8, 16, 24, 32 | `--expert-cache-slots` | 16 | More slots can retain more routed experts and reduce later reads, but values above 16 use more RAM. Chunked prefill requires at least 16 slots. |
| Expert-cache policy | LFU | `--expert-cache-policy lfu\|lru` | LFU | Chooses which expert is evicted when the cache is full. |
| Prompt prefill | On, off | `--prefill on\|off` | On | On processes known prompt tokens through the chunked prefill path. Off disables that path. |
| Prefill chunk size | 128 | `--prefill-chunk-tokens 32\|64\|128\|256\|auto` | 128 | Sets the number of prompt tokens processed by each chunked-prefill step, and has no effect while prefill is off. Chunks loop outside layers, so each one re-reads that layer's routed experts: fewer, larger chunks read less. `auto` picks the smallest size that covers the prompt. On the server `auto` is the cap, 256: a per-request size is the smallest allowed size covering the span, so the cap prefills every prompt in exactly those spans, and the KV ring is sized from the cap either way. Only the prefill scratch is sized from the chunk, at about 125.5 KB per token over a fixed 328 KB, so the cap holds about 32.5 MB of it against 16.4 MB at 128, and a per-request size would reallocate it whenever the chosen size moved. On a 7,019-token prompt, 256 measured 16% faster than 128 with byte-identical output. |
| RDADVISE | Off, Default, Bounded, Adaptive | `--rdadvise off\|default\|bounded\|adaptive` | Off | Applies experimental read advice. Its effect depends on the workload; it may help a short decode and slow a long one. |

In the app, changing context length, expert-cache slots, or RDADVISE requires a
reload. Some sampling changes also require a reload because greedy and sampled
generation use different output-head paths. Prompt-prefill settings apply to
each turn and do not require a reload. A reload ends the retained KV lineage;
the app preserves the visible transcript and marks where the model's new
context begins. Each CLI invocation loads a new model process, so its selected
runtime settings apply immediately. The server fixes its runtime settings at
startup, so changing one means restarting the process;
`--prefill-chunk-tokens auto` resolves to the cap, 256, there, which allocates
about 32.5 MB of prefill scratch against about 16.4 MB at the 128 default.

### macOS interactivity mitigation

Before the first Metal device is created, TurboFieldfare defaults
`AGX_RELAX_CDM_CTXSTORE_TIMEOUT` to `1`. This relaxes an AGX context-store
deadline that can terminate a long prefill dispatch as
`kIOGPUCommandBufferCallbackErrorImpactingInteractivity` on macOS 26. It is a
mitigation, not a guarantee: failures have also been reported with the setting
enabled.

Export `AGX_RELAX_CDM_CTXSTORE_TIMEOUT=0` before launching TurboFieldfare to
restore stock driver behavior. An explicit environment value is never
overwritten. If a command buffer still fails, the error includes its prefill
phase label, Metal status, domain, code, and IOGPU diagnostic token without
including prompt or generated content.

## Image controls

Image input needs the companion pack installed beside the text model. Without
it, these controls have nothing to select.

| Control | Values | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Vision pack | directory | `<model>.vision.gturbo` beside the model | Where the companion pack is read from. If you pass a path that does not exist, the load fails. It does not fall back to serving text with the images missing. |
| Vision residency | `on-demand`, `keep-ready` | `on-demand` | `on-demand` releases the routed-expert streamers and their slot scratch before encoding, then recreates them for language prefill. `keep-ready` maps the tower during the load and leaves it mapped. Changing this requires a reload. |

The CLI takes `--vision-pack` and `--vision-residency`, plus `--image <path>`,
which is repeatable, and `--chat-prompt`. The server takes the first two.

A request whose images cannot fit the selected context is refused before any
pixel is decoded. The rejection reports the token cost, not the number of
images, because an image's cost scales with its dimensions.

## Run an experiment

1. Start from the 8K default context, 16 expert-cache slots, prefill on, and
   RDADVISE off.
2. Keep the prompt and generation controls fixed.
3. Record a baseline after a warmup.
4. Change one runtime control and reload the app model, or start a new CLI run.
5. Compare prompt prefill, request TTFT, decode rate, peak memory, and I/O per
   token over repeated runs.
6. Restore the production defaults when the experiment ends.

Use the [community benchmark protocol](COMMUNITY_BENCHMARKS.md) for a standard
production result. A run with changed runtime controls is experimental and must
name the changed setting.

## Read the results

- **Decode rate** measures generated tokens per second after prompt prefill.
- **Request TTFT** includes prompt or new-turn prefill and the wait for the first
  generated token.
- **Peak memory** in Last run is the highest decode-service memory observed
  during the request. The HUD shows the service's current memory instead of the
  much smaller foreground UI process.
- **I/O / token** reports routed-expert read time per generated token.
- **Advanced** shows decode duration and per-token cb1, cb2, and output-head
  time. When RDADVISE runs, it also shows time, calls, data, and skipped advice.

During chunked prefill, the phase label reports exact progress, for example
`Prefill (128/514)`. Errors and unsupported configurations appear only when
they occur. RDADVISE remains experimental and is off by default. A measured
result is a data point, not a performance ceiling.

## Context length and memory

Use the default context unless you need a longer conversation: 8K in the app
and CLI, or 16K in the server.

The model supports up to 256K tokens, but larger contexts need more RAM. The
KV cache is allocated when the model loads, even if the conversation is empty.
The server also offers 96K and 192K.

The memory check includes the KV cache, 2 GiB for the runtime with 16
expert-cache slots, and 3 GiB for macOS and the file cache. Choosing 24 or 32
slots adds about 0.75 or 1.50 GiB. On an 8 GB Mac, neither leaves enough room
for 128K under this estimate.

When a setting exceeds the estimate:

- The app hides it and lowers an incompatible saved setting, with a notice.
- The server refuses to load.
- The CLI warns but continues.

For diagnostic runs, `TURBO_FIELDFARE_ALLOW_UNBACKED_CONTEXT=1` bypasses the
server check.

Passing the check doesn't guarantee enough free memory: it uses total RAM,
and other apps need memory too. Answer quality at 256K and memory use at 128K
on an 8 GB Mac still need testing. See the
[long-context report](experiments/summaries/10-long-context.md).

The app allows up to 32 images per message. The remaining context may fit fewer.
