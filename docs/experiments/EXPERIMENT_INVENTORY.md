# Experiment inventory

This is the curated experiment and decision index behind [Optimizing a 14.3 GB
model for an 8 GB machine](../OPTIMIZATION_JOURNEY.md). It records what shipped,
what worked only under a named condition, what failed, what a stronger gate
later reversed, and what the project never attempted.

Most readers should start with the article above. Use this inventory to find
the variants, controls, measurements, and final disposition of a specific
experiment. The entries are design archaeology, not an independent reproduction
package. Raw logs, traces, working plans, and project-state documents are not
part of this curated record.

The companion [implementation reference ledger](../IMPLEMENTATION_REFERENCES.md)
records the external model implementations, papers, kernels, and systems that
materially shaped the work, including sources that informed rejected paths.

## How to read the inventory

Each experiment has a stable ID and a detailed summary. The summary states the
hypothesis, variants, measured evidence, later reversal when applicable, final
disposition, and reusable lesson.

| Disposition | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| Production | Survives in the default runtime or frozen M2 reference profile. |
| Conditional | Helps only on a named host, workload, flag, or memory budget. |
| Rejected | Measured and not promoted. |
| Correctness repair | Required for valid output, independent of speed. |
| Reversed rejection | A better gate invalidated an early rejection; the later candidate shipped. |
| Scope decision | Deliberately not attempted. |
| Unexecuted hypothesis | Plausible idea without a completed runtime gate. |

## Terms used in the summaries

Common abbreviations: **cb1/cb2** are the first and second command-buffer
phases; **TG** is a threadgroup; **SIMDgroup** is Metal's lockstep execution
group; **GEMV** is matrix-vector multiplication; **QMM** is quantized matrix
multiplication; **MPP** is Apple's Metal Performance Primitives tensor path;
**GQA** is grouped-query attention; **SWA** is sliding-window attention;
**PSO** is a pipeline state object; **TTFT** is time to first token; **RSS** is
resident set size; and **NLL** is negative log-likelihood. See
[System design](../SYSTEM_DESIGN.md) for how these pieces fit together.

| [METH-02](summaries/09-validation-and-measurement-lessons.md#meth-02) | Claimed-lossless work still needs exact identity. | Retained strict gates for cache, storage, and load-width changes. |
| [METH-03](summaries/09-validation-and-measurement-lessons.md#meth-03) | Test production-shaped offsets. | Found the live 2-byte INT4 alignment defect. |
| [METH-04](summaries/09-validation-and-measurement-lessons.md#meth-04) | Prove synchronization scope. | Repaired one reused scratch bank; audited other paths by ownership and queue order. |

## Important non-experiments

These boundaries are not failed performance work:

- ANE/Core ML offload was excluded by architecture and platform scope.
- Weights below INT4 were cancelled by the quality floor.
- Draft-model speculative decoding did not reach a complete runtime candidate.
- Production routing was never cache-conditional.
- Fresh APFS preallocation remains unexecuted.
- The iPhone port is deferred; these are Mac measurements.

## How these summaries were prepared

Later revalidation overrides stale intermediate conclusions. These summaries
keep the evidence and final disposition readable without reproducing every raw
capture.
